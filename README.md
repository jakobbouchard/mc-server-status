# mc-server-status

This website enables people to see a Minecraft Server's status as well as some
other information including, but not limited to, the list of players, the list
of plugins, the list of mods if it is a modded server, as well as the ping.

## Features
- Custom made querying API with customizable update time.
- Responsive, mobile-first design.
- Progressive Web App / Offline mode.
- Multiple server support.
- Push notifications.
- User customization.
- Maybe OAuth for keeping user settings.
- Maybe LAN servers. (not sure how that works)

## Phases

I plan to develop this website in two big phases. One for the website, and the
other one for the API. The API phase will be the last one. Why is that? When
developing the website, I'll be using the [mcapi.us](https://mcapi.us) API, and
since I want my API to be similar, I don't need to develop it first.
